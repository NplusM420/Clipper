# Railway Deployment Checklist âœ…

## Pre-Deployment Verification Complete

### âœ… **Environment Variables**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Railway PostgreSQL connection string 
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Secure session key for production
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` - Cloud name: dapernzun
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - API key configured
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - API secret configured  
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Optional, for transcription service
- `PORT` - Auto-managed by Railway
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Will be set by Railway

### âœ… **Build Configuration**
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (client + server bundle)
- **Start Command**: `npm start` (production server)
- **Dependencies**: All required packages included
- **Build Output**: 
  - Client: `dist/public/` (HTML, CSS, JS assets)
  - Server: `dist/index.js` (bundled server)

### âœ… **Database Schema**
- **Tables**: `users`, `videos`, `video_parts`, `transcripts`, `clips`, `sessions`
- **Migrations**: Generated and ready (`migrations/0000_nice_firestar.sql`)
- **Video Chunking**: Full support for large file uploads
- **Push Command**: `npm run db:push` (if schema changes needed)

### âœ… **Production Features**
- **Static File Serving**: Configured for `dist/public/`
- **WebSocket Support**: Socket.IO with Railway CORS support
- **Real-Time Progress**: Complete upload tracking system
- **Video Chunking**: Automatic 90MB chunk splitting
- **FFmpeg Integration**: Configured via nixpacks.toml
- **Cloudinary Upload**: Async processing for large files

### âœ… **Railway Configuration Files**
- `railway.toml` - Deployment and health check settings
- `nixpacks.toml` - System dependencies (Node.js 18, FFmpeg)
- Package.json scripts optimized for Railway

## Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. **Connect to Railway**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to existing project or create new one  
railway link
```

### 2. **Set Environment Variables**
```bash
# Set production environment variables
railway variables set DATABASE_URL="your-railway-postgres-url"
railway variables set SESSION_SECRET="your-secure-session-secret"  
railway variables set CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="dapernzun"
railway variables set CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
railway variables set CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key" # Optional
railway variables set NODE_ENV="production"
```

### 3. **Deploy Application**
```bash
# Deploy current branch to Railway
railway up

# Or connect to GitHub for automatic deployments
# (Recommended for production)
```

### 4. **Database Setup**
```bash
# Push database schema (if needed)
railway run npm run db:push
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### âœ… **Health Checks**
- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] Health check endpoint `/api/user` responds
- [ ] Database connection established
- [ ] WebSocket connections work
- [ ] Static files served correctly

### âœ… **Feature Testing** 
- [ ] User registration/login
- [ ] Video upload (small files)
- [ ] Video upload (large files - chunking)  
- [ ] Real-time progress tracking
- [ ] Video transcription
- [ ] Clip creation
- [ ] All UI components load

## Production URLs
- **App URL**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- **API Base**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/api`
- **WebSocket**: Same domain as app (auto-configured)

## Monitoring & Logs
```bash
# View application logs
railway logs

# Monitor deployment status
railway status

# View environment variables  
railway variables
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build Failures**: Check Node.js version (18) and dependencies
2. **Database Connection**: Verify DATABASE_URL format  
3. **FFmpeg Errors**: nixpacks.toml should install FFmpeg automatically
4. **WebSocket Issues**: CORS configured for *.railway.app domains
5. **File Upload Limits**: Railway has 32MB request limit (chunking handles this)

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# SSH into Railway deployment
railway shell

# Check FFmpeg availability
railway run ffmpeg -version

# Test database connection
railway run npm run db:push
```
