# Video Controls Not Visible – Root Cause and Fix (2025-08-31)

## Symptom
- Custom play controls in the right sidebar did not appear in the UI, even though they are implemented in `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` under the "Video Tools" section.

## Root Cause
- The right sidebar layout used a flex column without proper overflow handling.
- The container that hosts "Video Tools" was growing beyond the available vertical space and content below the fold (including the control panel) was clipped by an ancestor with `overflow-hidden`.
- Result: the control panel rendered, but it wasn't visible because the area wasn't scrollable and the child could not shrink.

## Fix
- Make the right sidebar and its tools container shrinkable and scrollable.
- Edits made in `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`:
  - Set the sidebar wrapper to `min-h-0` to allow it to shrink within the `main` container that has `overflow-hidden`.
  - Set the "Video Tools" container to `min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` so content can scroll.

```
- <div className="w-80 border-l border-border bg-card flex flex-col">
+ <div className="w-80 border-l border-border bg-card flex flex-col min-h-0">
...
- <div className="flex-1 p-6">
+ <div className="flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto p-6">
```

## Verification
- `npm run check` passes (TypeScript ok)
- `npm run build` succeeds
- UI: With a `selectedVideo` present, scroll inside the right sidebar’s "Video Tools" area; the bright red/green bordered "VIDEO CONTROLS SECTION" appears with buttons (Skip Back/Forward, Play/Pause, Mark Start/End).

## Notes
- Controls are conditionally rendered under `{selectedVideo && (...)}`; ensure a video is selected.
- The player currently uses native controls inside `VideoPlayer.tsx` (`controls={true}`), while the custom controls live in the sidebar and operate on the shared `currentTime` state.

## Next Enhancements
- Wire play/pause to the underlying video element via a ref for full parity with native controls.
- Add keyboard shortcuts (space/arrow keys).
